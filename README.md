Develop a customer segmentation project using machine learning in python and implement the following subparts:-

i) Create customer gender visualization to show gender distribution across the dataset using bar plot and pie chart.<br>
ii) Plot a histogram to visualise the distribution of frequencies of customer ages.<br>
iii) Analyze the annual income of customer by plotting a histogram and a density plot.<br>
iv) Analyze the spending scores of customers and examine the outliers count using a box plot.<br>
v) Use K-means clustering and find optimal number of clusters to segment the dataset on the basis of customer spending score and salaries (annual income).<br>
